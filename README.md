### Forking The Repo

1. In order to make changes, you will need to fork the repository. Click on the **Fork** button in the top-right corner of this page.
2. You will now need a copy of these files on your computer to make changes. To do this, you will need to clone or download the repo you forked in the previous step onto your local computer:
    - Click on the green **Clone or download** button
    - Under **Clone with HTTPS**, copy the clone URL for the repository
    - Open your Git terminal
    - Type ```git clone``` followed by the URL copied in the second step. This should look something like the following:
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/fullstack.git
```
3. Once you have the file path all written down, go and hit Enter on your keyboard to request the clone.

### Making Changes

Now you're all set to make changes. You can open the project on you preferred text editor or IDE and begin making changes.

### Submitting Pull Requests

Now that you've made changes to the portfolio, you can submit a pull request to the master branch to await approval. To do this:

2. Click on **New pull request** on the right of the Branch menu
3. On the compare page, click **compare across forks**
4. Confirm that the *base fork* is the repository you'd like to merge into
5. Use the *head fork* drop-down menu to select your fork, then use the compare branch drop-down menu to select the branch you made your changes in
6. Type a little description for your pull request
7. If you do not want to allow anyone with push access to the upstream repository to make changes to your PR, unselect **Allow edits from maintainers**

### UX/UI Testing

Manual tests were carried out at every stage to ensure the user experience standards remained at consistently high levels with each new implementation, no matter how big or small. This proved an excellent way of identifying and thwarting any issues, reducing the time spent on bug fixes to a small fraction.

### Media

Many of the images from this site have been sourced from Unsplash. I created a [collection](https://unsplash.com/collections) which I called using their API https://source.unsplash.com/collection/{COLLECTION ID} during testing. This worked particularly well as it's quick and lightweight. An example of how it was used can be seen below.

```css
section.intro {
    background: linear-gradient(rgba(245,245,245,1),rgba(204,204,204,0.6)), url("https://source.unsplash.com/collection/3320800/") no-repeat center center / cover;
}
```
