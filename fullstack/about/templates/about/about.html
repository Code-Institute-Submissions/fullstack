                    I am a north London based Computer Science / Information Technology graduate.
                    After graduating from the University of Hertfordshire, I was fortunate for having
                    the experience of developing two main company websites for an exciting IT solutions
                    company, Joskos Solutions, as a Marketing Executive Assistant. Not only strengthening
                    my skillset in web development, this role also developed my knowledge within digital
                    marketing and graphic design outside my comfort zone. Alongside this I also worked as
                    a Technician for Dixons Carphone for over three years, where my passion for the
                    ever-growing technology soared. I also embarked on a short project for 360GSP, an IT
                    training and recruitment company, as a Designer / Developer which solidified my skills
                    using the latest industry standards.

                    Due to the nature of the web development industry which is continuously growing at an
                    exponential rate, I wanted to ensure I have the relevant skills and knowledge to tackle
                    real world scenarios within the industry. This is where Code Institute comes in. I am
                    currently studying for a Diploma in Software Development through Code Institute in a
                    course which is aligned and accredited by the Edinburgh Napier University. Upon completion,
                    I will fulfil my goals of becoming a Full Stack Web Developer which will enable me to
                    integrate both Front End and Back End systems seamlessly.
